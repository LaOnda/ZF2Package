- Rewrite Pyrus build process to:
  - depend on having a composer package for the given version
  - use the composer package for the given version in order to create the
    pyrus artifacts
- Create Makefile
  - [X] ensure satis has all deps (i.e. that `build/zf2/vendor` is not empty)
  - [X] run satis with given options
  - replace `public/index.html` with our own information (?) (or merge the
    satis-generated `index.html` with ours)
  - build pyrus packages (per above)
  - build ZF2 dist packages
    - use composer package as base
    - build and release documentation packages
    - build and release apidoc packages
